It then calculates the correlation between the air quality index and the number of respiratory disease cases for each city.\n            Similarity Score: 0.5642\n\nPrompt: What is the correlation between air pollution and respiratory diseases in major cities?\n            SQL: SELECT A.City, CORR(B.Cases, A.Level) AS Correlation FROM AirPollutionData A JOIN RespiratoryDiseaseData B ON A.City = B.City WHERE A.City IN ('New York', 'Los Angeles') AND B.Disease = 'Asthma';\n            Explanation: This query calculates the correlation between air pollution and respiratory diseases in major cities by joining the air pollution and respiratory disease data on the city column, then calculating the correlation between the level of pollutants and the number of respiratory disease cases. It filters the data to only include New York and Los Angeles and asthma cases.\n            Similarity Score: 0.6860\n\nPrompt: List the locations with increasing pollution levels over time.\n            SQL: SELECT Location, Pollutant, Level, LEAD(Level) OVER (PARTITION BY Location ORDER BY MeasurementDate) as NextLevel FROM PollutionData;\n            Explanation: This query gets the next level of pollution for each location, partitioned by Location and ordered by MeasurementDate.\n            Similarity Score: 0.7165\n\nPrompt: What is the average air quality index at each mining site in the past month?\n            SQL: SELECT SiteName, AVG(AQI) FROM AirQualityData WHERE DateMeasured >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month' GROUP BY SiteName;\n            Explanation: This query calculates the average air quality index at each mining site in the past month by selecting the SiteName column and averaging the AQI column for all rows where the DateMeasured is within the past month, calculated as the current date minus one month, and grouping the results by SiteName.\n            Similarity Score: 0.7354\n\nPrompt: What are the top 3 locations with the highest pollution levels and the corresponding average pollutant levels?\n            SQL: SELECT location, AVG(level) as avg_level FROM Pollution GROUP BY location ORDER BY avg_level DESC LIMIT 3;\n            Explanation: This query retrieves the top 3 locations with the highest pollution levels and the corresponding average pollutant levels from the Pollution table. The GROUP BY clause groups the records by location, the AVG function calculates the average pollutant level for each group, and the ORDER BY clause orders the groups in descending order based on the average pollutant level. The LIMIT clause limits the results to the top 3 records.\n            Similarity Score: 0.7434","aqi","Table: auth_group\nColumns: id (INTEGER), name (VARCHAR(150))\n\n\nTable: auth_group_permissions\nColumns: id (BIGINT), group_id (INTEGER), permission_id (INTEGER)\n\n\nTable: auth_permission\nColumns","SELECT city_name FROM cityairquality WHERE air_quality_index > 75","9.881079196929932"
